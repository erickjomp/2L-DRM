akways check performance comparison vs using static arrays 
see comparison tests in 
/data/keeling/a/erickkc2/f/SAAG2/testSAAG3_4km_origmodel_copy    for static array
/data/keeling/a/erickkc2/f/SAAG2/testSAAG3_4km_origmodel_copy2   for dynamic arrays (i.e. using allocatables)

These test cases need to be improved to habe both equal conditions, test 1 seems to be computing like 20 less days and reading 1 less set of files.
But these tests can give an idea of speed.

Avoid compiling with checking at runtime for copiling final exceutables, it slows the exexution. We dont have to see runtime warning or some like that when running
But for debugging is useful.
